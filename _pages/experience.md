## Experience

#### Interactive Optimization and Learning @ Zuse Institute Berlin

Student Research Assistant, 08/2021 - Present

- <span style="font-size:16.5px"> Given a feature map, devised a mathematical scheme for kernel herding iterates and implemented finite and the Matèrn kernel in the infinite-dimensional setting to simulate acceleration.
- <span style="font-size:16.5px"> Developed new mathematical schemes for alternating linear minimizations over strongly convex sets and polytopes to prove accelerated convergence rate.



#### Industrial Mathematics Center on Big Data @ Pusan National University

Graduate Research Assistant, 03/2019 - 08/2020

- <span style="font-size:16.5px"> Designed a mathematical model to improve work efficiency in a large hospital. The model is on average 10% more efficient than the existing system and reduces 50% of outliers.
- <span style="font-size:16.5px"> Developed models to predict real estate prices using machine learning tools to analyze and interpret big time-series data.
- <span style="font-size:16.5px"> Translated “Gilbert Strang, Linear Algebra and Learning from Data” (Cambridge Univ Pr, 2019) into Korean in a team.
- <span style="font-size:16.5px"> Held a seminar on basic Python to analyze data and led a project on “Making a better city.”
